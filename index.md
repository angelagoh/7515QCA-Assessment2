Certain frequencies vibrate the metal plate in such a way that it creates areas where there is no vibration. The sand and water vibrates and creates beautiful geometric patterns and effects. As the frequency increases in pitch the patterns become more complex.

Granules are driven by gravity and topography forming an analogue particle system. A moving slanted plane and a grid of motorized stamps control the elements to form infinite variations of behaviors and patterns.

## Conceptual progress ##
### Area of interest ###
Visual and/or auditorial interaction with recorded biometric data.

### Design intent ###
A representation of distress and stress through recorded biofeedback.

### Design concept 1: Emotional Cube ###
An LED cube with heart rate sensors on wristbands. This is an LED cube that vibrate, buzzes and flashes colour when there is a change to the heart rate of the user. The purpose of this emotional cube is to indicate a change in heart rate, signifying the possibility of distress. This could be used in a situation where the user have problem communicating their feelings – for example, pets, babies etc. This however, would require some research to be conducted. Standard, average heart rate should be determined and programmed accordingly.

### Design concept 2: Tension Wristband ###
DESCRIPTION:
INSERT SKETCH:
OTHER NOTES: 

### Final design concept: Philocaly *(Working Title)*  ###
### Initial concept: Heart Rate Sensors ###
A heart rate controlled drawing machine that translate the heart rate by plotting pen to paper. The purpose of this design concept is to capture and artistic representation of stress and distress. 

After some research, it might be too hard for me to use heart rate/pulse as the chosen biofeedback. The parts required to make this concept work requires Arduino and would require some time to learn (personally). I have decided that it might be better to come up with an alternative rather than learning a whole new program. 

### Current concept: Pressure Sensor###
Using pressure to control the drawing machine. Fulfils the same purpose but have more flexibility when it comes to prototyping. The current design concept utilises a stress ball to trigger the mechanics of the drawing machine. When held and squeezed, the data collected will trigger the motor to start drawing until the stress ball is let go.

SKETCH:
### OTHER NOTES: ###
A couple of things that might be figured out as we progress along in the prototyping phase (will be updated):
*	There is a variety of ways to measure the pressure (will have to determine which is the best way)
a. Plotting the analog pin pressure-sensitive sensor 

b. Flex sensor 

c. Thin-Film Pressure Sensor 

d. Force Sensitive Resistor
*	Shape of the stress “ball” to be determined (based on what works best with the chosen pressure sensor)
*	Different variation of drawing based on the different range of pressure
*	Current medium is pen to paper, might look into the effect of using paint as an medium etc. 


### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
