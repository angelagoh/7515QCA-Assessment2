Certain frequencies vibrate the metal plate in such a way that it creates areas where there is no vibration. The sand and water vibrates and creates beautiful geometric patterns and effects. As the frequency increases in pitch the patterns become more complex.

Granules are driven by gravity and topography forming an analogue particle system. A moving slanted plane and a grid of motorized stamps control the elements to form infinite variations of behaviors and patterns.

## Conceptual progress ##
### Area of interest ###
Visual and/or auditorial interaction with recorded biometric data.

### Design intent ###
A representation of distress and stress through recorded biofeedback.

### Design concept 1: Emotional Cube ###
![Image of Design Concept Sketch 1](/Images/DCS1.jpg)

*Drawing is not propotionate to size, the cube propose in the ideation process is visualised to be at least 300x300x300 (mm).

An LED cube with heart rate sensors on wristbands. This is an LED cube that vibrate, buzzes and flashes colour when there is a change to the heart rate of the user. The purpose of this emotional cube is to indicate a change in heart rate, signifying the possibility of distress. This could be used in a situation where the user have problem communicating their feelings – for example, pets, babies etc. This however, would require some research to be conducted. Standard, average heart rate should be determined and programmed accordingly. This design concept would be a visual and auditorial representation of distress.

### Design Concept 2: Tension Wrist Cuffs ###
A heart rate sensing wristband (Wristband) and a receiver inflatable wrist cuff (Wrist Cuff). The inflatable wrist cuff is design to tighten with when the pulse sensing wristband reads an increased pulse rate from the resting heart rate. The higher the read, the tighter the cuffs. The purpose of this tension wristband is to indicate body distress of the wearer of the wristband. This design concept would be a tacticle representation of distress. 

### Design Concept 3: Activation Fidget Cube ###
![Image of Design Concept Sketch 3](/Images/DCS3.jpg)

*Drawing is not propotionate to size, the fidget cube propose in the ideation process is visualised to be at least 30x30x30 (mm). Actual interface design to be determined.

This fidget cube controls the x and y axis of the pen plotter. The 6 faces of the cube will have a variation of touch sensitive trigger points, the point of activation will trigger the pen plotter moving in accordance to the directional movement of the set interface creating a distress inspired drawing. This design concept would be a visual representation of distress.

### Final design concept: Philocaly *(Working Title)*  ###
![Image of Design Concept Sketch 4](/Images/DCS4.jpg)

**Initial concept: Heart Rate Sensors**

A heart rate controlled drawing machine that translate the heart rate by plotting pen to paper. The purpose of this design concept is to capture and artistic representation of stress and distress. 

After some research, it might be too hard for me to use heart rate/pulse as the chosen biofeedback. The parts required to make this concept work requires Arduino and would require some time to learn (personally). I have decided that it might be better to come up with an alternative rather than learning a whole new program. 

**Current concept: Pressure Sensor**

Using pressure to control the drawing machine. Fulfils the same purpose but have more flexibility when it comes to prototyping. The current design concept utilises a stress ball to trigger the servo motors with extensions. When the interface is held and/or squeezed, the data will be translated to the servo motors to extend and retract. This extension motion will push the suspended drawing platform allowing the painting ball to move around the canvas organically. The purpose of this design concept is to capture the artistic representation of stress and distress of the user, hence the stress ball interface.

**Main Components (required/as thought of in ideation):**
* Motors: <a href="https://www.jaycar.com.au/servo-motor-standard-6-volt-with-metal-gear-11kg/p/YM2765">Servo Motor</a> | <a href="">Stepper Motor</a>
*	Different variation of drawing based on the different range of pressure
*	Current medium is paint and paper. (Paint covered ball) 
*	Shape of the stress “ball” to be determined (based on what works best with the chosen pressure sensor)

A couple of things that might be figured out as we progress along in the prototyping phase. There is a variety of ways to measure the pressure (will have to determine which is the best way, to be updated):
* Plotting the analog pin pressure-sensitive sensor 
* Flex sensor 
* Thin-Film Pressure Sensor 
* Force Sensitive Resistor

### Interaction flowchart ###
**!This interaction flowchart is based on the use of a flex sensor interface.**

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

Waiting on the flex sensor to arrive in the mail, in the mean time have tried testing the interface with switches.

In this process there are a lot of trial and error, as there are a few components to the design concept that I am unfamiliar with it has taken a while to learn how to connect and test if they are working with the Micro:bit. The servo motor requires 4.5V - 6v to power, and I have had to get an 5v power breadboard to be added into the circuit as seen in the images above. At this stage, the servo is moving however the movement are weak and I am currently solving connection problem to ensure power gets supplied to the servo.

Click image to see the movement test. 

This is the suspended drawing platform, where the servo motors will come in contact from the bottom. This "push" movement from the servo extension will enable the platform to tilt accordingly to how the interface is being held, moving the steel balls (will be covered in paint).

## Next steps ##
* Determine which pressure sensor works the best
* Determine the shape of the interface
* Determine if there are alternative material when creating the interface (Water, slime, powder etc.)
* Determine the number of servo motor, if more servo would create a more dynamic artwork
* Determine the surface material of the drawing platform (What would a softer surface affect?)
* Determine the number of painting ball, does it affect anything
* Determine if there is a way to transmit the pressure data wirelessly
